# üö® Missing Critical Capability: AI/ML Engineering

The AI/ML Engineering capability announced in our recent practice expansion is missing from the capabilities management platform.

During last week's all-hands meeting, our CTO announced a significant investment in AI/ML capabilities to meet growing client demand. However, when consultants try to register for this capability, it's not available in the system.

I can see several other technology capabilities are properly configured:

- ‚úÖ Cloud Architecture
- ‚úÖ Data Analytics  
- ‚úÖ DevOps Engineering
- ‚úÖ Cybersecurity

## ‚è±Ô∏è Urgency

This is time-sensitive as we have several client proposals requiring AI/ML expertise due next week. Multiple consultants have completed their [Microsoft AI Certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/) and [AWS ML Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty/) and are ready to be registered.

Current consulting demand includes:
- Generative AI strategy consulting
- MLOps implementation
- AI ethics and governance
- Machine learning model development

## üí° Expected Outcome

The AI/ML Engineering capability should be added with appropriate:
- Skill level definitions (Emerging through Expert)
- Required certifications (AWS ML, Azure AI, Google ML, etc.)
- Industry vertical mappings
- Capacity planning for upcoming projects
